# A Weekend in Cinque Terre #

## Our weekend itinerary (which we highly recommend!) ##

- Friday: Arrive in Pisa at 20h30, walk around city, dinner and sleep.
- Saturday: Visit Pisa, train to Vernazza, lunch in Vernazza, hike from Monterosso to Vernazza, dinner & sleep in Vernazza
- Sunday: Hike from Vernazza to Corniglia, train to visit Manarola and Riomaggiore, and back to Vernazza to pick up our bags.  Then train back to Pisa.  Dinner in Pisa.  

## Our recommendations of where to eat ##

- Pisa: Drinks at [Bar Mocambo](https://www.facebook.com/bar.pisa), cool little book-lined bar with good music, good people and a great happy hour!  Dinner at [Le Scuderie](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pizzeria-Le-Scuderie-Pisa/189791677738694), amazing meter-long (and cheap) pizza.
- Cinque Terre: [Il Pirata delle 5 terre](http://www.ilpiratarooms.com/) (Vernazza) for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner (doesn’t have the views, but it has the best food - esp the croissant with ricotta, no joke — and the “Cannoli brothers” are hilarious and excellent conversationalists).  [Belforte](http://www.ristorantebelforte.it/) (Vernazza) for lunch or dinner (amazing views and good food).

## Where to sleep ##

- Pisa: sorry can’t help you here, we weren’t big fans of our B&B.   
- Cinque Terre: [La Rosa dei Venti](http://www.larosadeiventi-vernazza.it/) in Vernazza - clean, quite, lovely, and Giuliana is great.  

## How to get there and around? ##

- Getting to 5T: Fly to Pisa and then take a [train](https://www.lefrecce.it/B2CWeb/search.do?%20) to 5T - super convenient and easy.  I think you can do the same from Genoa.  
- Getting around in 5T: Hike, train, or boat.  *No need for a car*.  In fact, it’s more of a burden than a convenience.

## What to do in 5T? ##

Note: Even in October, 5T is overly crowded with tourists.  It’s still amazingly magical.
Hiking between the villages is INCREDIBLE and the best part of visiting Cinque Terre. The trails are challenging at times, but relatively short, so don’t give up!  And make sure to catch “Jean-Pierre”,  with a lemon products stand between Monterosso and Vernazza selling his delicious lemonade, limoncello, grappa, wine…..
If it rains, the trails might be closed, which is a big bummer…
Don’t get overly excited about the food, you will eat well— but it’s not Sicily.
Besides hiking and eating, there’s not much to do.  Just relax.  And enjoy the immense beauty.
