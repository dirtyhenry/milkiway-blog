#One week in North Vietnam: Just do what we did!

So you have one week in Vietnam, not sure what to do, and just want to have an awesome, chill, beautiful and delicious vacation?  And don‚Äôt feel like spending hours scouring the internet and comparing 878934 tours that all look the same?
Then don‚Äôt think too much, just do what we did!

## Who we are 

Two American women friends in our early 30s who hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a while.  We decided to meet up in Vietnam for one week.

## What we were looking for 

A chill, fun week to spend some quality time together.  Delicious food, fascinating culture, and nature and beauty.  Not really looking to party, but ok for a little bit of that if the opportunity presented itself ‚Äî which it sort of did‚Ä¶ üòÉ

## What we did 

6-days/6-nights: 2 days in Hanoi, 2 days in Sapa, and 2 days in Halong Bay
* 21/04 (Thurs): Arrive in Hanoi early morning.  Spend the day in Hanoi (museums & food tour).  Night train to Lao Cai/Sapa
* 22-23/04 (Fri/Sat): 2-day/1-night trek & homestay with Sapa O‚ÄôChau.  One night in Sapa homestay, one night in night train back to Hanoi.
* 24/04 (Sun): Spend the day in Hanoi (explore, massage, night market, cool bars), night in Hanoi.
* 25-26/04 (Mon/Tues): 2-day/1-night trip to Halong Bay.  One night on boat in Halong Bay, last night in Hanoi.
* 27/04 (Wed): Fly out Wednesday morning.

## Budget 

Vietnam is crazy cheap.  I‚Äôd say we went ‚Äúmid-range‚Äù on everything we did, and ended up spending about $400-450/pp for the week.

## Did we get what we were looking for?  

Definitely.  And we let you know below what we would do differently (mainly Day #2 in Hanoi).

## General logistics 


### Tour agency

[Sapa O‚ÄôChau](http://www.sapaochau.org).  
We found them on the internet and contacted them to organize a trek in Sapa.  They ended up organizing everything for Sapa and Halong Bay:
- Train and shuttle to/from Sapa
- Sapa trek (2d/1n)
- Transport to/from Halong Bay
- Halong Bay cruise (2d/1n) with Gray Line Cruises (originally it was Lavender Cruises, and it changed somewhere along the way which was not very clear, and we didn‚Äôt ask questions and it was fine)

People told us we could just book everything in Hanoi and we‚Äôd probably get cheaper prices, but we were so happy to have booked ahead of time to avoid the hassle of visiting countless agencies in Hanoi and trying to negotiate.  And turns out we got a way better deal than other passengers on our cruise.  Shhh!

We ended up paying $76 for the train and shuttle to Sapa r/t, $50/pp for the Sapa trek, and $110 for Halong Bay (all-inclusive) = $236.

### Hotel in Hanoi 

[New Vision Hotel](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Hotel_Review-g293924-d2303643-Reviews-New_Vision_Hotel-Hanoi.html).  
Amazing service.  The people working there were extremely kind and helpful.
The breakfast was surprisingly copious and delicious.
Central location in the Old Quarter near the lake.
Basically, great value for the money.  We paid $15/night.  For two people.
The rooms were decent, clean, comfortable, and quiet with good air-conditioning.  Not high-luxury, but again, great value for the money.

### Airport 

The hotel (New Vision) ended up organizing our airport transport ($20 each way).  We definitely recommend organizing a pick-up service ahead of time because there are a lot of taxi scams.  You can get cheaper than $20 (probably $10-15), but we liked our hotel, so we just went with them.  The ride to/from the airport is a good 45min so make sure to plan accordingly.

### Visa 

If you need a visa, make sure to do it [online](http://www.vietnamvisapro.net) (and have ids photos ready!) and we would totally recommend paying the extra $15 to do the ‚Äúfast track‚Äù service. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be sitting in the airport waiting for 1.5 hours.

### Money/tipping

The currency is the Vietnamese Dong (VND).
The exchange rate is about $1=23,000 VND, 1‚Ç¨ = 25,000 VND (April 2016)
It‚Äôs sometimes hard to do conversions quickly, so have some benchmarks in mind:
‚Äî A Pho soup will cost about 35,000-60,000 VND (~$1.5-2.5)
‚Äî A coffee about 25,000-50,000 VND (~$1-2)
‚Äî Museums: 30,000-40,000 VND ($1.3-$1.7)
Again, things are cheap so if you want to avoid the hassle of stressing over money, just don‚Äôt think too hard, you might be paying $0.50 extra from time to time, that‚Äôs ok.

### Tipping

We never figured out the tipping situation, we got massages one day and weren‚Äôt sure if we were supposed to tip, so we left 20,000 VND per person.  They made it very clear that they did not appreciate our tip...

### Getting around in Hanoi 

Hanoi is pretty walkable but beware in the Old Quarter, there are no sidewalks.  Actually there ARE sidewalks, but they are completely useless.
Also, crossing the street seems terrifying at first.  But the key word is CONFIDENCE.  Just go for it.  They know how to get around you.
You can also take taxis but be careful because we got scammed going from the train station to our hotel.  We didn‚Äôt totally figure out how to avoid that.

So yea, I recommend asking the hotel how to deal with tipping and taxis.

### Season/Weather

We went in April 2016.  And had pretty good weather.  High 80s and sunshine.  There were some surprise rainstorms that caught us off guard.  And Hanoi did get almost unbearably hot and humid one day.  But generally speaking, no complaints about the weather.
The original plan was to go to Cambodia.  Until we found out that April is the hottest month in Cambodia and temperature averages are in the high 90s/100s Fahrenheit (38-40 Celsius).  South Vietnam is similar to Cambodia.

North Vietnam however, is much more temperate during this period. Apparently it gets cold in the winter months (Dec-March).  And then extremely hot and rainy in the summer months (Jun-Sep).  So yeah, to sum it up, it seems the best time to visit North Vietnam is April/May or Oct/Nov (we did good yay!).

### Shopping 

Personally, I would avoid shopping (trying to buy souvenirs, clothes, etc) in Hanoi.  Unless you like the "crowded and stressful market / constant negotiating atmosphere".
If you are like me (don‚Äôt want stress) but still want to buy some souvenirs and gifts for people, think about buying Hmong bags in Sapa.  And/or there were some ‚Äúposter‚Äù shops that were a little less crazy in Hanoi.  And/or ‚Äî the most simple option: just shop at the airport.  It wasn‚Äôt that much more expensive and SO much more of a relaxing experience.
Gift ideas: Hmong bags, bamboo bowls, communist propaganda notebooks, and Weasel poop coffee!

## HANOI - SAPA - HALONG BAY: THE DETAILS

### Hanoi

**The good:** Museums.  Food tour.  Massage.  The lake.

**The bad:** ‚ÄúWandering the streets‚Äù.  Trying to shop.  Sunday market.  Taxis&Tipping.

Our first day in Hanoi (Thursday), we visited museums and did a food tour.  It was awesome.
* The museums.  They are super interesting (lots of communist propaganda rhetoric), cheap, and air-conditioned.  We went to the Hoa Lo Prison Museum, Army Museum, and the Women‚Äôs Museum.  And walked by Ho Chi Minh‚Äôs museum (it was closed when we went, if you want to go inside, make sure to look at the hours).  And the Temple of Literature.
If you‚Äôre not a museum person and just want to do one, I would recommend the prison museum.
*Food tour.  We did the 5pm 3-hour [Hanoi Street Food Tour](http://www.hanoistreetfoodtour.com), before jumping on our night-train to Sapa.  It‚Äôs maybe a bit cheesy but a great way to discover Hanoi, the food, and some cool restaurants.  $20.  It‚Äôs right near the hotel, so we just booked it in the morning for the evening tour.

Our second day in Hanoi (Sunday), we explored the Old Quarter, got a massage, went to the Sunday night market, and then went to some cool bars & restaurants.
* Wandering/exploring in Hanoi: I don‚Äôt recommend it.  Walking in Hanoi is stressful and uncomfortable.  Make sure you have a destination.  And do not plan to just ‚Äúwander‚Äù for a couple of hours.
* The Sunday market: Also, not recommended.  Crowded and stressful.  But if you have market FOMO, just plan to go for 30 min to check it out.
* The massage: We went to a place near our hotel (I threw out the brochure so I don‚Äôt remember the name üòî ).  The 1-hour massage was good and cheap (240,000VND= $10), but again, figure out what is a good tip so you don‚Äôt walk out feeling like they hate you.
* Some cool places to hang out / get drinks:
* 
[Hanoi Social Club](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d2216014-Reviews-The_Hanoi_Social_Club-Hanoi.html) ‚Äî Really pretty decor, great music, vegetarian food, relaxing atmosphere.  Great place to hang out with your journal or catch some live music.

[Bar Betta](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d3588861-Reviews-Bar_Betta-Hanoi.html) ‚Äî Free beer nights on Wednesday and Sunday! üòÉ Again, a really cool place with a roof terrace.

So yea, if we could do the second day again, I‚Äôd recommend:
Morning: hang out by the lake, have a coffee and read/write
Lunch: go to one of the places on the food tour, or any one of the numerous local Pho‚Äô or Banh My (= easy, delicious sandwich) places
Afternoon: Get a massage, take a nap, and then head to the Hanoi Social Club for an afternoon tea.
Evening: Grab a quick bite somewhere, and then head to Bar Betta for some drinks from 8-10pm.  If you‚Äôre like us and that‚Äôs enough partying, head back to the hotel.  If not, continue onto the Beer Corner for some more partying!

### Sapa

**The good:** Amazing hikes and views, an awesome guide, and just a wonderful homestay family experience (delicious food, medicinal baths, really cute kids, getting drunk on rice wine and singing non-stop‚Ä¶).

**The bad:** Be prepared for rain!  And Hmong women following you and trying to sell you stuff on the hike.  But to be honest, it wasn‚Äôt that bad.  They were super cute and smiley.

If we had one more day in Vietnam, I would use it in Sapa.  It‚Äôs so incredibly beautiful.  And peaceful.  And unique.
For the hike, we were four women (us + 2 women from Singapore) with one guide, Pay.  Pay was AWESOME.  His English was really good.  He was super funny.  And man, he loved to sing (he just needs a bit of rice wine to get started).
We did the Red Dao Homestay Trek which was perfect for us.  Physical but not too strenuous.  Enough time to soak in the experience and relax (especially in the funny medicinal baths).  Delicious.  And fun.
We were hesitating at first between this trek and one of the motorbike tours.  In the end, we opted for the trek AND on the second day, we had time to rent motorbikes for a couple hours (we asked Pay and Sapa O‚ÄôChau just organized that too).  That was awesome.  Do that.  üòÉ

### Halong Bay

**The good:** Incredible views, delicious food, really nice rooms.

**The bad:** Too many activities planned, expensive on-boat drinks, and you feel like you‚Äôre part of a ‚Äútourist-factory‚Äù being shuttled in and out of everything.

I would have liked to visit Halong Bay in a more ‚Äúoff the beaten track‚Äù kind of way, but not sure it‚Äôs possible.  At least not in a easy, affordable, laid-back way.  So the tour we did was fine.  You just need to zone out all the cheesy tourist planning, music, etc.  Or embrace it!

Advice: there are a lot of activities scheduled (caves, hike, kayak,‚Ä¶).  They are nice, but if you have this vision of just vegging out on the top deck of the boat and reading/sleeping/doing yoga, do that!  No need to FOMO.  You will have an incredible experience even if you never step off the boat.  Also, bring a big bottle of water or two, to avoid paying 3x the price for half the water (this being said, we‚Äôre still talking $1.5/ bottle).

Above all, ENJOY.  EAT.  RELAX.
And if you haven‚Äôt seen "Good Morning Vietnam", do that now.
